# Faze4-Robotic-arm

## This is still work in progress  !!!

Little bit about the arm: 
This is fully 3d printable diy 6 axis robotic arm . 5 joints use cycloidal gearboxes and 1 uses planetary, they all use steppers motors. There are no encoders, arm needs to home on every startup by hitting limit switches on each joint.
It has around 1000 parts , and weights around 15 kg.

What you can find in this repository at this moment:
- assembly instructions
- BOM
- C++ / arduino code for testing the robot


Things i will add soon:
- STL files
- STEP files
- wiring instructions
- simscape models
- matlab code for trajectories
